const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'How does the tax calculator work?',
    answer: 'The tax calculator computes your income tax liability based on current tax slabs for both old and new regime. It considers your income, deductions, and applicable tax rates to provide accurate tax calculations and regime comparison.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between old and new tax regime?',
    answer: 'The old regime allows various deductions under sections 80C, 80D, etc., with higher tax rates. The new regime offers lower tax rates but with limited deductions. Choose based on your deduction eligibility and income level.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which tax regime should I choose?',
    answer: 'Choose the old regime if you have significant deductions (>₹1.5 lakh annually). Choose the new regime if you have minimal deductions and want to benefit from lower tax rates. Use our calculator to compare both options.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I switch between tax regimes?',
    answer: 'Yes, salaried individuals can switch between regimes every year while filing ITR. Business owners who once opt for new regime cannot switch back to old regime. Choose carefully based on your financial situation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What deductions are available in the old regime?',
    answer: 'Old regime allows deductions under 80C (₹1.5L), 80D (health insurance), 80E (education loan), 80G (donations), HRA, LTA, and many others. These can significantly reduce your taxable income.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there any deductions in the new regime?',
    answer: 'The new regime has limited deductions including standard deduction for salaried (₹50,000), employer contribution to NPS, and interest on home loan for self-occupied property (up to ₹2 lakh).'

                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>
                    With the updated tax slabs for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27), the new tax regime has become even more attractive for 
                    middle-income taxpayers. The increased exemption limit to ₹4 lakh and the new 25% tax slab for ₹20-24 lakh 
                    income range provide significant tax savings opportunities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Choosing the right tax regime can significantly impact your take-home income. Use our tax calculator to compare both 
                    options with the latest FY 2025-26 slabs and make an informed decision. Remember to review your choice annually as 
                    your financial situation changes. The new regime's simplified structure and lower rates make it ideal for those with 
                    minimal deductions, while the old regime remains beneficial for heavy investors in tax-saving instruments.
