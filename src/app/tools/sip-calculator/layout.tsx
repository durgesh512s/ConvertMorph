          "question": "How is SIP return calculated?",

      },
      {
          "question": "What is the difference between SIP and lump sum investment?",
          "answer": "SIP involves regular monthly investments, benefiting from rupee cost averaging, while lump sum is a one-time investment. SIP reduces market timing risk."
      },
      {
          "question": "Can I change my SIP amount during the tenure?",
          "answer": "Yes, most mutual funds allow you to increase or decrease your SIP amount. You can use our calculator to compare different scenarios."
      },
      {
          "question": "What is a good SIP amount to start with?",
          "answer": "Start with an amount you can comfortably invest monthly. Even â‚¹500-1000 per month can create significant wealth over long periods due to compounding."
      },
      {
          "question": "How accurate are SIP calculations?",
          "answer": "Our calculator provides estimates based on assumed returns. Actual returns may vary due to market conditions, fund performance, and other factors."
      },
      {
          "question": "What is the ideal SIP tenure?",
          "answer": "Longer tenures (10+ years) are ideal for wealth creation due to compounding benefits. However, choose tenure based on your financial goals and needs."
